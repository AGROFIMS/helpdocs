<!-- ### Page ordering

By default, pages are sorted on the weight assigned to them in their <code>frontmatter</code>. This is set in <code>config.toml</code>, using <code>orderSectionsby = "weight"</code>. Change this to <code>"title"</code> to sort pages alphabetically based on their title instead. Alternatively, do not assign a weight to any pages and it will also sort them alphabetically on their title.


### Table of contents

By default, a table of contents (ToC) is generated for each page in the right side menu. This can be disabled using:







    
    




<div class="position-relative">
    <div class="position-absolute" style="right:0;">
        <button class="btn btn-light" data-clipboard-target="#clipboard_04197ee706">
        Copy
        </button>
    </div>
    <div id="clipboard_04197ee706">
    <pre><code class="language-<nil>" data-lang="<nil>">
toc = false

</code></pre>
    </div>
</div>





in the <code>config.toml</code> or the <code>frontmatter</code> (a page's markdown file) for a page-wide or page-specific disabling of the ToC respectively.

### Google Analytics

Enable Google Analytics by adding your GA tracking ID to the <code>config.toml</code> file, at:






    
    




<div class="position-relative">
    <div class="position-absolute" style="right:0;">
        <button class="btn btn-light" data-clipboard-target="#clipboard_77a1e5ce9a">
        Copy
        </button>
    </div>
    <div id="clipboard_77a1e5ce9a">
    <pre><code class="language-<nil>" data-lang="<nil>">
googleAnalytics = &quot;XX-XXXXXXXXX-X&quot;

</code></pre>
    </div>
</div>




Where <code>XX-XXXXXXXXX-X</code> is your tracking ID.


### Read more navigation

In <code>config.toml</code> or a page's <code>frontmatter</code>, set <code>disableReadmoreNav = true</code> to disable the prev/next buttons at the buttom of every page.


### Search

Disable search by setting <code>disableSearch = true</code> in <code>config.toml</code>.  --><blockquote>
