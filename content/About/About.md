The Agronomy Field Information Management System (<a href="https://agrofims.org/" target="_blank">**(AgroFIMS)**</a>AgroFIMS) allows users to create fieldbooks to collect agronomic data. The fieldbook is already tied to a metadata standard (the CG Core Metadata Schema, aligned with the industry standard Dublin Core Metadata Schema and required by CGIAR and many other repositories). The data variables and protocol parameters in AgroFIMS fieldbooks align with semantic standards like the  and semantic standards like the <a href="https://bigdata.cgiar.org/resources/agronomy-ontology/" target="_blank">**Agronomy Ontology** (AgrO)</a>. This a priori compliance with data standards facilitates data to be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) at collection, making it easier to interpret and aggregate.
Data collection is currently available via the Android-based <a href="http://www.kddart.org/kdsmart.html" target="_blank">**KDSmart**</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fieldbook.tracker&hl=en&gl=US" target="_blank">**Field Book**</a> applications, and the collected data can be imported back to AgroFIMS for statistical analysis and reports. 

By mid-2021 you will be able to easily upload this collected data through AgroFIMS to a Dublin Core or CG Core-compliant Dataverse repository. In 2021 AgroFIMS will also allow you to set up agronomic survey questionnaires, for data collection via
<a href="https://getodk.org/" target="_blank">**ODK**</a>.

To enable access, exchange, and integration of agronomic data across systems and applications we have made available the Agronomy API or AgrAPI, which is a RESTful web service API specification. The AgrAPI blueprint can be implemented in different programming languages, but is currently implemented in the R statistical programming language, allowing you to analyze your data with the R packages and graphics of your choice.

Funding for AgroFIMS was provided by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundationâ€™s Open Access, Open Data Initiative, and the <a href="https://bigdata.cgiar.org/" target="_blank">  **CGIAR Platform for Big Data in Agriculture**</a>.
