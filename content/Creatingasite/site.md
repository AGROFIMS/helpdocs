Before creating your fielbook, you may want to create the site where your experiment is to occur.

1.	Select **Sites** in the navigation menu at left on the home page.
2.	Click on the button **New site**.
3.	Add information about the site type, site name, country name and administrative divisions using text boxes and picklists as appropriate. You can zoom into the map to find the name of your location, but you cannot use the map to directly pinpoint the site and have all the administrative information automatically filled. 
4.	Once you have filled in information about the site, it should be pinpointed on the map. 
5.	Click **Create** at the bottom left of the page.
