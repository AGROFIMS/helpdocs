Open tools for open science



In the AgroFIMS project, we are strong advocates of enriching the community with open tools for agronomists and researchers in general. AgroFIMS is composed by:

- a web application based on Angular, HTML and Javascript;

- R-packages to facilitate the design and analysis of agronomic data;

- Pythons and Java rutines to facilitate the conversion of AgroFIMS files to mobile applications such as KDSmart and Field Book.

You can find the open source code  https://github.com/AGROFIMS/
