In the AgroFIMS project, we are strong advocates of building the community by providing open tools and trainings for agronomist and researchers in general. AgroFIMS is composed by 

- web applications based on Angular, HTML, Javascript; and 

- R-packages to facilitates the design and analysis of agronomic data.

- Pythons and Java rutines to facilitate the conversion of AgroFIMS file format to mobile applications such as KDSmart and Fieldbook App.

People in general, can find all the open source code in https://github.com/AGROFIMS/

<!-- ### Page ordering

By default, pages are sorted on the weight assigned to them in their <code>frontmatter</code>. This is set in <code>config.toml</code>, using <code>orderSectionsby = "weight"</code>. Change this to <code>"title"</code> to sort pages alphabetically based on their title instead. Alternatively, do not assign a weight to any pages and it will also sort them alphabetically on their title.


### Table of contents

By default, a table of contents (ToC) is generated for each page in the right side menu. This can be disabled using:

{{< code >}}
toc = false
{{< /code >}}

in the <code>config.toml</code> or the <code>frontmatter</code> (a page's markdown file) for a page-wide or page-specific disabling of the ToC respectively.

### Google Analytics

Enable Google Analytics by adding your GA tracking ID to the <code>config.toml</code> file, at:
{{< code >}}
googleAnalytics = "XX-XXXXXXXXX-X"
{{< /code >}}
Where <code>XX-XXXXXXXXX-X</code> is your tracking ID.


### Read more navigation

In <code>config.toml</code> or a page's <code>frontmatter</code>, set <code>disableReadmoreNav = true</code> to disable the prev/next buttons at the buttom of every page.


### Search

Disable search by setting <code>disableSearch = true</code> in <code>config.toml</code>.  -->
