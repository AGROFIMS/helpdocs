In the AgroFIMS project, we are strong advocates of enriching the community with open tools for agronomists and researchers in general. AgroFIMS is composed by:

- a web application based on Angular, HTML and Javascript;

- R-packages to facilitate the design and analysis of agronomic data;

- Pythons and Java rutines to facilitate the conversion of AgroFIMS files to mobile applications such as KDSmart and Field Book.

You can find the open source code at https://github.com/AGROFIMS/

<!-- ### Page ordering

By default, pages are sorted on the weight assigned to them in their <code>frontmatter</code>. This is set in <code>config.toml</code>, using <code>orderSectionsby = "weight"</code>. Change this to <code>"title"</code> to sort pages alphabetically based on their title instead. Alternatively, do not assign a weight to any pages and it will also sort them alphabetically on their title.


### Table of contents

By default, a table of contents (ToC) is generated for each page in the right side menu. This can be disabled using:

{{< code >}}
toc = false
{{< /code >}}

in the <code>config.toml</code> or the <code>frontmatter</code> (a page's markdown file) for a page-wide or page-specific disabling of the ToC respectively.

### Google Analytics

Enable Google Analytics by adding your GA tracking ID to the <code>config.toml</code> file, at:
{{< code >}}
googleAnalytics = "XX-XXXXXXXXX-X"
{{< /code >}}
Where <code>XX-XXXXXXXXX-X</code> is your tracking ID.


### Read more navigation

In <code>config.toml</code> or a page's <code>frontmatter</code>, set <code>disableReadmoreNav = true</code> to disable the prev/next buttons at the buttom of every page.


### Search

Disable search by setting <code>disableSearch = true</code> in <code>config.toml</code>.  -->
