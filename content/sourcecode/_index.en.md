In the AgroFIMS teams, we are strong advocates of enriching the community with open tools for agronomists and researchers in general. AgroFIMS is composed of:

- a <a href="https://agrofims.org/" target="_blank"> web application </a> based on Angular, HTML and Javascript;

- R-packages to facilitate the design and analysis of agronomic data;

- Pythons and Java routines to facilitate the conversion of AgroFIMS files to mobile applications such as KDSmart and Field Book.

You can find the open source code <a href="https://github.com/AGROFIMS/" target="_blank"> here </a>.
