Once you have created a .zip file, you have to send it to the device where Field Book is installed. For this you have three options:

- **Via email**: send an email to yourself or the data collector, with the .csv and .trt files attached. Open this email on the mobile device where Field Book is installed and download the files.

- **Via a cloud storage service**: On your laptop save the .csv and .trt files on a cloud storage service (OneDrive, Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.). Open the same service on the mobile device and download the files.

- **Via USB transfer**: Connect the mobile device to your laptop to transfer the .csv and .trt files.
