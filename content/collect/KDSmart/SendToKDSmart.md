Once you have downloaded a .kdx file, you have to send it to the device where KDSmart is installed. For this you have three options:

-	Via email: send an email to yourself or the data collector, with the .kdx file attached. Open this email on the mobile device where KDSmart is installed and download the .kdx file in the folder ‘’Download’’ of the mobile device. 

-	Via a cloud: On your laptop save the .kdx file on a cloud-based service (OneDrive, Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.). Open the same service on the mobile device and download the .kdx file in the folder ‘’Download’’ of the mobile device. 

-	Via USB transfer: Connect the mobile device to your laptop. Save the .kdx file in the folder ‘’Download’’ of the mobile device.
