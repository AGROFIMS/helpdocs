In this section you can select phenological measurements to be made in the field. In case of an intercropping or a relay cropping trial, the measurements will be specified separately for each crop. 

1.	Select a measurement in the drop-down list. You can either scroll through the list or type the name of the measurement – the auto-complete feature will select the term if the measurement is in the list. 
2.	If the section is empty, verify that you have selected a crop in the Crop section. 
3.	Click on **Add measurement**.
4.	To remove a measurement, click on the red **x** at the upper right side of the measurement box.
