> In this section you can describe the experimental protocol and the information to be collected about practices or interventions made in the field over the course of your experiment. In case of intercropping or relay cropping, work in the tab called **Field** if the practice or intervention relates to the entire experimental field or work in a specific crop tab if the practices vary by crop.
