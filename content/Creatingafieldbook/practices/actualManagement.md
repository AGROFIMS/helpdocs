1. Go to the **Management practices** tab of your fieldbook.
2. Choose your management practices in the drop-down menu **Select management practices**.

6.	Repeat the above steps for each parameter for which you will collect information in the field. 

{{< notice note >}}
If both the **Planned protocol** and the **Actual management** are highlighted in blue, the management practice will be listed in the protocol tab with the value you have entered, and will also be listed as a measurement to be taken in the field. This is a way to control if the planned protocol has been followed or not.
