> This section is dedicated to the selection of soil measurements to make during the experiment.  

1. Go to the **Soil** tab of your fieldbook.
2. In case of intercropping or relay cropping trial, start by selecting the tab corresponding to one of the crops of the trial.

3.	Select a measurement in the drop-down list. You can either scroll through the list or type the name of your measurement – the auto-complete feature will select the term if the measurement is in the list.   
4.	Once you have found your measurement, select it and click on **Add measurement**.  
5.	You can then indicate its unit, the depth of the measurement, the number of times it has to be measured during the season, and its timing. 
6.	You can add as many soil measurements as needed.
7.	To remove a measurement, click on the red **x** at the upper right side of the measurement box.
