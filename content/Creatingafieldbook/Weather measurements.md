3.	Once you have found your measurement, select it and click on **Add measurement**.  
4.	You can then indicate its unit, the number of times it has to be measured during the season, and its timing. 
5.	You can add as many weather measurements as needed.
6.	To remove a measurement, click on the red **x** at the upper right side of the measurement box.
