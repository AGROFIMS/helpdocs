1. Select **Nutrient type and amount** in the factor list. 
2. Select the crop to which you will apply the nutrient, in intercrop and relay crop experiments. 
3. Once you have specified the type, levels and number of application splits, click on **Application details**.

8.	Click on **Calculate** to get the amount of product that must be applied in the field to get the level of nutrient desired. This information will be displayed in the Protocol tab of the Excel fieldbook and in “Trial attributes” in KDSmart. 

{{< notice note >}}
This calculation is currently on a per hectare basis; you will need to use this to calculate the amount required for the area over which you are applying the fertilizer. We will incorporate plot size into the calculation in an upcoming version.
