1.	Scroll through the dropdown menu or start typing the name of the factor; AgroFIMS will narrow down the possibilities for you. The factors are listed using broader categories. This means that if you want to test different amounts of urea, the factor you should select is **Fertilizer amount**. If you want to test different potato varieties, the factor will be Crop variety. 

2.	If the factor is not in the list, select **Other**. Then type the name of the factor in the text box, select the type of input, the unit if needed, and the levels.
