{{< notice note >}}
This calculation is currently on a per hectare basis; you will need to use this to calculate the amount required for the area over which you are applying the fertilizer. We will incorporate plot size into the calculation in an upcoming version. 


{{< notice note >}}
In case of P2O5 phosphorous fertilizer, the calculation provides the amount of elemental phosphorous.
