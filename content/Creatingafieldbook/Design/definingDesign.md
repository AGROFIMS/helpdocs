A <a href="https://stattrek.com/statistics/dictionary.aspx?definition=treatment" target="_blank">treatment</a> 
is a combination of factor levels. A factor is a controlled independent variable whose levels are set by the experimenter. Each factor has two or more levels (i.e. two or more different values).

To define the treatment of the experiment:

1.	Go to the **Design** tab of your fieldbook and <a href="https://agrofims.github.io/helpdocs/creatingafieldbook/design/specifydesign/" target="_blank">specify the design</a>.
2. Then, specify the number of treatments and repetitions (or blocks). 
3.	Select a factor in the list. If the factor is not listed, select ‘’Other’’ and specify the name of the factor. 
4.	Enter the levels of the factor. 
5.	To add another factor, click on **+ Add factor**. 
6.	For the CRD and RCBD designs, define the treatments by assembling the factors and their levels using the dropdown menus at the bottom of the page.
